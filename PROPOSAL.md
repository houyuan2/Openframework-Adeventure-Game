# Project Proposal

## Description

A 2D-graphic version of the adventure game. The player would control his character moving around a given 2D-space.

The character would be able to duel monsters and pick up items just as the adventure game that we previously made.
The player would use WASD to move his character around.

The Monsters will block the entrance to the next room. When the character move to the location of the monster, he
would be dragged into the duel mode. The monster and the player would take rounds and attack each other.
(Just like pokemon)

There will be weapons and supplys(to restore health) between the rooms. The character would have access to these item
after defeating the monster. In order to win the game, the player would need to move its character to the exit.

## Class

The game should have background music, which could be achieved by using the openframeworks ofSoundPlayer library

The should also be sound effects in the duel mode, which could be achieved by the same class

The graphic library should be used to construct the basic game panel, like rooms, monsters, etc.

## Reason



I really could not come up with a better idea. Making game seems like the most approachable stuff that
I could make, and I do think making a pokemon type of game would be very interesting.
